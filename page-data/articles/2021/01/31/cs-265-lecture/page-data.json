Professor Eric Schweitzer recalls that in the 1980s, Discrete Math (CSCI 150) was taught by a collection of adjunct professors. However, every adjunct put a unique emphasis on the \\\"standardized\\\" curriculum. So some may have spent more time on first order logic, while others delved into number theory. The department came to a decision that it was important for all students to have the same discrete math background for the major. The easiest way to do this is to have one professor teach.

The same principle applies not just to 265 but all our large lecture courses. We understand that being in a large lecture is not as attractive to students as small sections but with the rate the major has grown and the space limitations we face, this is the best solution we have.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This spring, 265 will be taught by Dr. Levitan with support from Teaching Assistants.
