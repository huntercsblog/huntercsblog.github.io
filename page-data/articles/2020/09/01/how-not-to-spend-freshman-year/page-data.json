Preventing these unmet goals from festering into self-hate and regret is crucial. One antidote is to identify procrastination as a set of unwanted behaviors that you perform when you don\\u2019t want to do something.

It was a few days before a final exam and Tim was struggling to sit down and get his cram session started. Every time he started reading chapters from the textbook, he ruefully succumbed to his phone which was constantly buzzing with notifications and messages from his friends. Unsure of what to do, he contacted me and we brainstormed solutions. Here\\u2019s what he ended up doing: Tim put his phone on airplane mode, his phone\\u2019s case on backwards, and put it in his backpack. Then he decided that he\\u2019d focus on studying for the next 5 minutes. I didn\\u2019t hear from him until the next day, when he told me he ended up studying for 3 hours.\"), mdx(\"h1\", null, \"2.
