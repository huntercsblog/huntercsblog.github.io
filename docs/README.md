## Usage

### Live

The master branch is always live [here](https://stoic-heyrovsky-3da9c7.netlify.app/).

### Dependencies
- `yarn`: Installs previous dependencies and updates lockfile (shouldn't be used by everyone).
- `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`: Installs previously listed dependencies, relying solely on lockfile (should be used).
- `yarn add PACKAGE`: Installs a new package, make sure you need it and someone else hasn't installed it already.

### Commands
- `npm run develop`: Run Gatsby website locally ([http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)) with hot reload.
- `npm run build`: Create static production build for website into `build/`.
- `npm run clean`: Get rid of previous cache of builds (usually unnecessary).
