I'm focusing on in this article is the fact that the city is trying to expand CS education in their k-12 curriculums.

The point I will try to make is that this is a good start, as a CS background is lacking in curriculums. 

I would also want to add a personal anecdote saying how I went to a hackathon which was won by fourth graders because they went to a private school and I was blown away with how much these 4th graders knew compared to how much I knew in the 11th grade.

That anecdote would be to try and exemplify how the NYC public education has not been up to standard in incorporating classes that develop the thinking required for CS.
